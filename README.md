# CS537-P4-xv6-Scheduling
All of these files should go in a src folder. But i accidentally created my Git repo down one directory and I am a bit too lazy to fix that rn. Anyway all you need to do is run "make qemu-nox" and you can run the xv6 shell.

In this project, youâ€™ll be modifying the Round Robin (RR) CPU scheduler in xv6 so that processes can have different time-slice lengths and are "compensated" in different ways for the amount of time they are blocked (and thus cannot be scheduled).
